# strapi-plugin-geopin

A Strapi 5 plugin for Postgres + PostGIS.

Largely based on [strapi-plugin-location](https://github.com/notum-cz/strapi-plugin-location) by [notum-cz](https://github.com/notum-cz). All credit goes to the original creator.

Due to this code being a fairly significant rewrite to make it work with Strapi 5, it's published as a separate plugin instead of a fork with updates. It's also my first Strapi plugin, so I'm using this project to try things out.

Reason for this plugin: PostGIS support was needed but nothing was available for **Strapi 5** that actually worked.
